You may download down and put it into your own drive,then you can `gdown <Drive Url to upload to server>` 

## Dataset Statistics
The dataset consists of five violations of expectation tasks:
A. Support
B. Occulsion
C. Containment
D. Collision
E. Barrier

## System Requirements
- Blender 2.83 with eevee engine
- **Python 3.6**
